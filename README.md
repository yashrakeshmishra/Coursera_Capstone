### Background

  Unfortunate incidents often occur on the road. The unpredictability of these accidents make them so dangerous. It is usually the impatient nature of the human which leads to an accident. But wouldn't it be a blessing if the number of accidents that occur on a daily basis be reduced? That is the problem which will be addressed in this project. As we know, accidents can happen anytime and anywhere. However, there are many factors which might influence the severity of the accident. For instance, these include the weather conditions, time of the day, the speed of the car and the area the car is being driven. These factors greatly contribute whether the accident will be severe or not. Having the information about the above mentioned factors can be used to predict if the accident happens can be severe or not. The indication that there is a possibility of a severe accident if it happens might warn the car drivers to drive more carefully and hence prevent accidents.

  This would greatly reduce the loss of life and also damage to the property. This would also help routing softwares to give a warning which would alert the drivers and their insurance companies which would help them in saving cost.
