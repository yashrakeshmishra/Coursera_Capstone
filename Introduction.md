## 1. Introduction

  It was summers and we decided to take a road trip to a nearby ski resort. We had our check in at 11:00 AM. Since we were students, it was an expensive resort for us and we wanted to make the most of our. We didn't check the weather forecast, and we assumed that our navigation would get us to the place in 4 hours. However, the weather was severe and we had to drive with our usual speed to reach on time. That is when our car lost the grip on the road and was flung across the shoulder into a tree. Luckily we survived the crash, however, the car was totalled. If there was a way which could analyse the weather conditions and the area from where we had to drive and informed us about the possibility of a severe accident, we would've left way early an driven at a much slower speed than the regular one. This would've saved us from the unfortunate crash and a hefty repair cost.

### 1.1 Business Problem

  Unfortunate incidents often occur on the road. The unpredictability of these accidents make them so dangerous. It is usually the impatient nature of the human which leads to an accident. But wouldn't it be a blessing if the number of accidents that occur on a daily basis be reduced? That is the problem which will be addressed in this project. As we know, accidents can happen anytime and anywhere. However, there are many factors which might influence the severity of the accident. For instance, these include the weather conditions, time of the day, the speed of the car and the area the car is being driven. These factors greatly contribute whether the accident will be severe or not. Having the information about the above mentioned factors can be used to predict if the accident happens can be severe or not. The indication that there is a possibility of a severe accident if it happens might warn the car drivers to drive more carefully and hence prevent accidents.

  This would greatly reduce the loss of life and also damage to the property. This would also help routing softwares to give a warning which would alert the drivers and their insurance companies which would help them in saving cost.
